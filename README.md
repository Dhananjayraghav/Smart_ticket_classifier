# Smart_ticket_classifier
Project Title: "Smart Customer Support Ticket Classifier" 

Tech Stack: Python, NLP (NLTK/Spacy), ML (Scikit-learn), Data Analysis (Pandas), Basic DSA (for optimization)  

Problem Solved: Automatically categorizes customer support tickets (e.g., "delivery delays," "billing issues") to prioritize and route them faster, improving response time.

Steps & Skills Demonstrated:

Data Collection & Preprocessing (Python, Pandas)
Scrape/simulate 500+ logistics-related customer tickets (use Kaggle datasets or mock data).
Clean text (remove stopwords, lemmatization) using NLTK/Spacy.
Feature Engineering (NLP, DSA)
Convert text to TF-IDF vectors.
Optimize pipeline with hashing/caching (basic DSA for efficiency).
ML Model Training (Scikit-learn)
Train a multi-class classifier (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest) to categorize tickets.
Achieve ~85% accuracy.
